Hello! My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a Sophomore studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. I am extremely passionate about mechanical design, structural efficiency and applied aerodynamics. I am also a chassis subsystem member on Cornell Electric Vehicles, a project team dedicated to building hyperefficient autonomous electric vehicles.
