## Kineon MOVE+ 3.0 Product Launch

For the Kineon MOVE+ 3.0 product launch, a consumer technology solution specializing in **photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy** via wearable LEDs and Infrared emitters, I executed the entire pipeline for marketing visuals.

### **CGI Production and Pipeline Execution**

* **Geometry Integration:** Imported finalized **CAD** geometry for the MOVE+ 3.0 device to establish a foundation for all renderings.
* **Advanced Shading:** Applied **Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material textures**, specifically utilizing:
    * **Subsurface Scattering** shaders for realistic skin-contact surfaces.
    * **Anisotropic Shaders** for accurate light reflection on metallic components.
    * Realistic **Lighting Environments (HDRI)** to achieve color-accurate lighting.
* **Animation and Rendering:** Executed the rendering process using **GPU-accelerated engines** (Cycles) to generate high-resolution assets, including:
    * Operational mechanism animations (e.g., exploded views).
    * Detailed, controlled hero shots.
* **Delivery:** Delivered all assets (e.g., PNG sequences, ProRes video) in **optimized formats** suitable for seamless integration across diverse digital marketing and campaign platforms.
